## Washington RCO Public Lands Application

The RCO Public Lands web application is a web application that allows people to click on a location and learn which agency owns the land, the number of acres, the main use of the land and the cost of acquisition if acquired within the past 10 years. Information is provided on land owned by cities, counties, the federal government and three state agencies â€“ the State Parks and Recreation Commission, the Department of Fish and Wildlife and the Department of Natural Resources. The public can search government-owned parcels by owner and principal land use. In addition, details about acquisition grants from RCO are linked to the interactive map.
